<p>The next 11 tutorials really do not focus on one or two particular themes.  However, sets of tutorials (around 2 or 3 of them) have a common idea behind them.  The one thing that I can say about this next set of tutorials (excluding the last 2 tutorials) is that the commands that you will learn are just little commands that can make your program better.  You could easily make good programs without these commands, but these commands help with the appearance or make a task easier.  It would have been nice to add the last two tutorials to the end of version 2.0, but I had already had enough tutorials and they somewhat deviate from the topic of version 2.0.</p>

<p>I will continue to use the space-saving methods that I used in version 2.0.  I will still leave off the ending " (quotation marks) and ")" (parenthesis) whenever possible.  I will also continue putting the screen shots after every code.  I hope that the screen shots are helpful to you because whenever I use tutorials, I always like to see what the output should look like.  It makes it easier for me to understand the code better when I know what it's supposed to look like.  Also, you'll be able to tell whether or not you messed up inputting the code if what you got differs from the correct one that I give you.</p>

<p>Once again there won't be a Big Game because there is no game that you can make that just uses these commands.  There will, however, be a project that you will have to accomplish in order to pass version 3.0.  Well, I think that is enough information before starting version 3.0  Now on to the next tutorial: Tutorial 24: Useful Characters.</p>
