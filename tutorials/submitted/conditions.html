<p>Condtions are used in a program to determine if a certain block
of code you set will be excecuted or not. For example, in a game
like Tron, where you are a continous snake and must avoid walls and 
trap your enemy, the program must be able to tell if you run into a 
wall. So IF you run into a wall, THEN end the program (as it would be 
a game over).</p>

<p>To make a condition inside a program, you would do this:</p>

<font color="#FFFFCC">
<p>(earlier code in the program)<br />:If (your condition is 
true)<br />:Then<br />:(do this)<br />:(do this)<br />:End<br />(remainder of 
program)</p>
</font>

<p>In this example, "your condition is true", can be any condition. 
For example, if you put "A=5" in this section, then when the 
program reached "If A=5", it would look at the value stored in the 
variable "A". If this value equaled 5, then the program would 
continue and execute the commands after the If statement and ignore 
the "End". If the value in A was not 5, the program will SKIP all 
commands after the If statement and will not continue excecuting 
commands again until it reaches its corrsponding "End"</p>

<p>The command "Then" must be used in all conditions were the number 
of commands to be executed if the statement is true is greater than 
1. Should you ONLY need one command executed if and only if the 
statement is true, than you could do this:

<font color="#FFFFCC">
<p>(earlier part of program)<br />:If (your condition is 
true)<br />:(do this)<br />(remainder of program)</p>
</font>

<p>As mentioned earlier, if you do not have a "Then", (in which case 
you also don't need an "End", it is implied that only the one 
immediate command following the If statement should be excecuted 
should the condition be true.</p>

<p>Let's make a program using this knowledge that will count to 
ten and stop. For the sake of this tutorial, I will make comments 
after a "//" which should NOT be entered into a program. This will 
not work inside a program. Create a new program and enter:</p>

<font color="#FFFFCC">
<p>:0->A<br />:Lbl 00 //Creates a label in the program, will be ignored 
for now<br />:A+1->A<br />:Disp A //Displays the value inside the 
variable A<br />:If A=10
<br />:Stop //This command 
will stop the program<br />:Goto 00 //This statement will goto the 
place in the program where the "Lbl" with the corsponding two ending 
digits is located (In this case it is "00")</p>
</font>

<p>There are much better ways to create this program, but it would 
require a lot of explaining that I will do in another tutorial 
and it may confuse you to learn too much all at one time. (I honestly 
don't mean any offence by that).</p>

<p>Run the program. Look at the program. Does it make sense? The 
program will keep going through itself and going back to "Lbl 00". 
Each time it goes through, A is incremented by one. When A reaches 
10, the program will stop.</p>

<p>You now know the basics of conditions</p>

<p>Now, we will take a closer look at conditions and find out what 
makes them work and some advanced meathods of creating 
conditions.</p>

<p>If statements use what is called "Boolean Logic". In that everything 
is either Off or On. 1 represents On, and 0 represents Off. "Not(" 
is a command that will take the opposite of a number using Boolean 
Logic. Also, any nonzero number is considered On, not just 1. See for 
yourself. On the homescreen type:</p>

<font color="#FFFFCC">
<p>not(5) //press enter to get "0"<br />not(Ans) //press enter to 
get "1"</p>
</font>

<p>The opposite of 5, since it is non-zero, is zero. The opposite of 
0, in every case, will then be 1. </p>

<p>If statements use this to determine if a statemnet is true or not. 
Say you have If A=5, same as last time, the program will check the 
statement to see if it is true. If it is, a 1 is assigned to the 
condition. If it is not true, a 0 is assigned to the condition. Now 
the statement has only two possible answers 1 or 0. The If statement 
will consider itself true if the assigned value is nonzero. This type 
of thing does not nessisarily need to be in an If statement. Have you 
ever seen anything like this?:</p>

<font color="#FFFFCC">
<p>:X+(A=26)-(A=24)->X</p>
</font>

<p>This, at first can look very confusing. What could A be? Say A 
equals 24. The conditions inside the parentheses will be anylized. 
(A=26) will become a zero as this is false, and (A=24) will become a 
one as it is true. What you end up with is "X+0-1->X" or "X-1->X" if 
A=26, then going back through this line, we would end up with 
"X+1->X". However, only when A=24 or A=26, will the value inside X 
ever be changed as all you would get in any other condition is 
"X+0-0->X" or "X->X".</p>

<p>There are times that an adaption off of the above command may come 
in very useful. Conditions like this can be inserted into almost 
anything. Use your imagination. "There is a better way to do it.
