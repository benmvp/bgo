<p>Here are a few things you should know before going on to the tutorials.  In other tutorials, I feel that the authors assume too much, figuring that you already know some information.  Well, since I'm starting from the extreme beginner's level, I will try not to say something without a good explanation.</p>

<p>At the beginning of each tutorial, there will be an introduction explaining in further detail what the topic is.  Underneath that will be the new commands that will be used in the code, which will be accompanied by definitions.  You'll be able to click on the new commands to find further, more in depth, definitions.  Most of the definitions you'll see in this entire Tutorial are partly or totally taken from the definitions in the TI-83 Graphing Calculator Guidebook.  Also, in the commands section will be the basic formula on how to use each command.  Following that is the actual code, which will have comments to the right explaining what each line means.  Just below the actual code will be pictures of what the screen(s) should look like.  They will be the output of what you inputted into your calculator.  Usually, underneath the output screen(s), I will add further explanation if I feel that a particular part in the code needs more explaining.  Finally, at the bottom will be a conclusion, which will just be an overview of the tutorial and any comments that I have to say.  At the end of the conclusion it'll tell you what tutorial is coming up next and what it'll cover.  Underneath all that, will be a sentence that says that if you do not understand any part of this lesson, that you should contact me.  I will make sure to check my mail every day, probably more than twice a day.  Once I get your email, I will try to respond as quickly as possible with the best help that I can give.</p>

<p>If you are copying the code manually to your calculator, you can find all the commands by pressing <img src="../index/2nd.gif" width="19" height="11" border="0" align="middle" alt="2ND" /> and <img src="0.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" align="middle" alt="0" /> <font color="#FFD700">[CATALOG]</font>.  Then just press the first letter of that command and scroll down until you find the particular command that you're looking for.</p>
