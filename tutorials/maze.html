This code is a code for the maze that I use in my game The Ultimate Maze 2000 v1.0.  It just contains lines and pixels.  To <a href="../cgi-bin/archives/ti-83plus/games/progs.pl?prog=maze">download the game</a>, visit The Ultimate Maze 2000 information webpage.  I must warn you that the code for the maze is extremely long.  If you have the TI-Graph Link software and cable, you might want to <a href="maze.zip">download the code</a>, and just send it to your calculator.  Here's the code:</p>
