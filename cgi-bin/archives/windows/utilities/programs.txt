basicguru|BASIC 83 Guru v2.5|**Update** Special release...version 2.5. Version 2.5 does not have any new tutorials in it. There are still 23 tutorials, a game, and a project. What Version 2.5 does have is screen shots of what your outputs should look like. There is at least one screen shot after each set of code to show you what the program should look like after you have run it. I have also fixed Goto.html, which is in the Archive Contents. Now it actually goes to BASIC Guru Online, the online version of this help file. The online version contains the same information, but has more features including easier navigation between tutorials and other web pages and faster updates. The help file only gets update after each version is finished (about 11 or 12 tutorials), while the website is updated after every tutorial is finished. Use the help file or the website. Both will make you a better programmer.|Ben Ilegbodu|1|windows/utilities|Windows Utilities|340,646|No|null|null|5|24|94
