superpac|SUPER Pac v1.5|Nice Pac-Man clone where you have to eat the dots and squares to get lots of points. This computer version (made in C++) is a port of the TI 83/83+ version. It's much faster than the calculator version and has many more features including sound. In order to beat the game you have to pass all 10 levels, which is no easy task. It takes lots of skill and a little luck to do that. This game might seem just like another old clone, but it is truly a lot of fun and very addictive. This is a game to keep on your calculator for sure. My high score is 1659, dying on level 5.|Ben Ilegbodu|1|windows/games|Windows Games|67,287|Yes|superpac.txt|superpac.gif|4|17|94
