First King of Shannara|Sean Sartell|27|staind234@hotmail.com|TI-83 Plus|BASIC|RPG|10% completed|The loading system for the screens is basically done except for a few minor adjustments to anable battles, castles, and homes.  Its a bit different from the screen shot but more or less the same.  I'm intending on creating the ability to have a party to battle with, graphical battles, and possibly multiple character sprites to walk around with.   I'm going to divide the game into seperate packets which will have to be ungrouped as you go along.|June 29, 2001|fkos.gif|37|20
