advti|Advanced TI-Windows v3.6|Advanced TI-Windows v3.6 is an update of the previous version. It is a windows look-a-like Shell-like program with mouse. With the menus: file, preferences, utilities, and ?(help). On the desktop you can open 3 games and open your own programs by pushing ALPHA. I have used for the desktop ALPHA instead of 2ND to keep the program run smoothly. It has the following assembly subroutines: Open, Shutdown, Background, PXL Change, Contrast, Memory, Protector, Avail Prgm, Version and when nescessary Alphalock. 3 Different backgrounds are included, can be changed anytime! Memory can be checked with the util menu.|Erik J. Beerlage|9|ti-83/assembly/misc|TI-83 Assembly Miscellaneous|14,545|Yes|advti.txt|advti1.gif*advti2.gif*advti3.gif*advti4.gif|4|15|100

break|Fake Break Message|This might sound stupid, but it's a funny joke to pull on your friends when you run program Z, it brings up a picture of the ERR:BREAK menu. There is no run indicator in the corner to tip off your friend that it's fake. If you push the up and down arrows, it works just like the menu. The only difference is that if they press Enter, nothing happens! If they press [ON], there is no change in the screen, but the menu works right. It's great, if your friends are simple-minded...|Joey Gannon|77|ti-83/assembly/misc|TI-83 Assembly Miscellaneous|1,443|No|null|null|1|3|15
