am|Advanced Math v1.2|A math program with the following math rules: Logarithm, Power of, Differentiate, Integrate, Sin/Cos-rules, Sin/cos/tan-rules, and Special triangles. No input!! Only the rules are plotted in the graph screen! The program doesn't use subroutines anymore!! Look at my screenshots.|Erik J. Beerlage|9|ti-83/basic/math|TI-83 BASIC Math|2,470|Yes|am.txt|am1.gif*am2.gif*am3.gif*am4.gif|2|8|70
factor|The Best Quadratic Factoring Program v1.5|This program FOILs out quadratic equations. If the value of "X" is imiginary or irrational, then it'll write "-NOT FACTORABLE". The program takes a little while to display the answer, but it comes out exactly perfect. Plus the program is really small, only about 1 kilobyte.|Ben Ilegbodu|1|ti-83/basic/math|TI-83 BASIC Math|761|No|null|factor.gif|1|4|83
benquad|The Complete Quadratic Formula Program v5.5|Math Program in which user inputs coefficients of a quadratic equation and finds out what X equals and how the equation is factored. If X is not a rational number it will display it exactly how it would look simplified in the Quadratic Equation. Also shows the graph, and gives the discriminant and the vertex of the equation. You can also view the value for X in decimal form. Can correctly handle a negative value for A and fractional values for A, B, or C.|Ben Ilegbodu|1|ti-83/basic/math|TI-83 BASIC Math|3,334|Yes|benquad2.txt|benquad.gif*benquad2.gif|3|15|89
dist|Distance Formula v1.0|This will find the length of a line in space or on a coordinate plane. Just input the X, Y, and Z coords (just put 0 for Z if you're doing a plane) of the endpoints of a line and it will calculate the length in both radical form and full answer.|Joey Gannon|77|ti-83/basic/math|TI-83 BASIC Math|266|No|null|null|1|3|38
frac83|Fraction Calculator Add-On 83|This program converts decimals to fractions and vice versa automatically. It looks just like the Ti-Os. No menus and no BS. Title screen only appears once.|Jason D. Ralphs|37|ti-83/basic/math|TI-83 BASIC Math|5,306|Yes|frac83.doc|frac83a.gif*frac83b.gif|1|3|50
equation|Linear Equations Solver v1.0b|This program does all sorts of linear equations. It can solve regular linear equations, linear equations that have the square/cube root of a number, and linear equations with 'X' as an exponent. There is no documentation because all of the instructions are in the program.|Ben Ilegbodu|1|ti-83/basic/math|TI-83 BASIC Math|1,788|No|null|null|2|6|72

probwork|Probability Workshop|Probabiliy Workshop is a great program that has a fraction calculator, performs both combinations and permutations, has a random number generator, and has a roll dice feature.|Jason D. Ralphs|37|ti-83/basic/math|TI-83 BASIC Math|503|No|null|null|1|3|52
radsimp|Radical Simplifier v5.0|Math program in which the user inputs a number, the index (root), and a coefficient, and the computer displays a reduced form of the radical. It does roots up to 99 and numbers up to 1E15.|Ben Ilegbodu|1|ti-83/basic/math|TI-83 BASIC Math|2,373|Yes|radsimp.txt|radsimp.gif|1|4|61
shapes|Shapes 2001 SE|This program provides the surface area and volume of five space figures. (Sorry, no S.A. for a cone, but I DID write the S.A. for a pyramid using only L, W, and H.) For the Cone, Cylinder, and Sphere, you can get your answers in full or in terms of pi. (For example, a cylinder with r=5 and h=8 would have a volume of 628.3185. If you get it in terms of pi, you would know that the answer was also 200 pi.)|Joey Gannon|77|ti-83/basic/math|TI-83 BASIC Math|562|No|null|null|2|8|38
solver|Solver|It's a solver wher you can solve x. e.g.: 2X+3=X/23|Stefan Broos|50|ti-83/basic/math|TI-83 BASIC Math|545|Yes|solver.txt|null|1|3|67
trigid|Trigonometric Identities v1.5|Contains all the fundamental trigonometric identities, including the reciprocal, quotient, pythagorean, cofunction, even/odd, and sum & difference identities. There is no input, but just the formulas. Great for cheating on tests...|Ben Ilegbodu|1|ti-83/basic/math|TI-83 BASIC Math|1,049|No|null|null|1|3|63
