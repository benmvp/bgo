maze|The Ultimate Maze 2000 v2.0|A 1-player ultimate maze game. It has 5 different levels and a high score for each. It also has special keys: Save, Pause, Quit, and a Teacher Key. Although the main objective of this game is to make it to the finish, the main purpose is just to get as far as you can.

If you somehow manage to make it all the way through and reach the finish, you will be awarded 1,000 extra points. The beauty of this game is that even if you happen to win it'll still be fun the next time you play because the correct route is almost impossible to remember.
