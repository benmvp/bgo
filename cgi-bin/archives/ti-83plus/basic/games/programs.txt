It takes a while to complete, but you can save your progress at any point so you can resume at a later time. It has a lowest number of tries "Low score" feature. It was hard to program and involved lists, matrices, and all that good stuff. If you are looking for an advanced and functional use of lists and matrices, this is it. The programming is optimized and is made for every situation. I wrote such a long description because this was a very hard game to make. You'll realize that once you look at the code. It took me a few tries and a few days to make it so it is worth your time. Look for a later version with difficulty levels.
