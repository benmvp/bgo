batt|Batt|Batt is a funny little program that mimics the low battery message on the 83+. Send to a friends calc or just use it with the startup app.|Jason D. Ralphs|37|ti-83plus/basic/misc|TI-83 Plus BASIC Miscellaneous|302|No|null|null|1|3|56

cbox|Chatterbox v1.0+|Ryan Church and I wrote this Basic 2-calc chat program. If you push Get Message, it will retrieve an 8-line message from the linked calc. If you push Write Message, you can write an 8-line message for the other person's retrieval. While writing your message, do not type any more than 16 characters per line. (The last character you can type will go directly under the question mark.) Also, if you are done with your message before you've filled 8 lines, simply type a space in the next blank line and all of the other lines will be automatically filled. I am NOT responsible if you are caught doing this in class, but I would be a hypocrite to tell you not to do it...|Joey Gannon|77|ti-83plus/basic/misc|TI-83 Plus BASIC Miscellaneous|570|No|null|null|1|3|40

ed|Erase Draw|Have you ever drawn a picture on your calculator and messed up, but couldn't delete the mistake? Well now you can. First get the picture onto the graph screen by saving it and then by recalling the Pic. Then exit the graph screen without deleting or clearing the pic. Then run the program and enter the co-ordinates (A= is the vertical co-ordinate and B= is the horizontal co-ordinate). Use the arrow keys to move the cursor which will delete any pixel it is moved over. Press Mode to Quit. Then go to the graph screen and save the new pic under the same number and you are done.|Justin Faerman|22|ti-83plus/basic/misc|TI-83 Plus BASIC Miscellaneous|511|No|null|null|1|3|53

genome|Genome Decoder 1.0+|People think it's weird that I walk around school playing with and programming a calc. When they ask what I'm doing, I get them to shut up by running this program and saying, "I'm decoding the human genome." There are three modes (Decimal, Hexadecimal, and Binary) on the two screens (128 cps = home screen, 240 cps = draw screen). The only way to quit is to break it by pushing On. Of course, this program is not actually decoding the genome, but is just displaying random numbers.
