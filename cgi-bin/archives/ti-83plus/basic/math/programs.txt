am|Advanced Math v1.2|A math program with the following math rules: Logarithm, Power of, Differentiate, Integrate, Sin/Cos-rules, Sin/cos/tan-rules, and Special triangles. No input!! Only the rules are plotted in the graph screen! The program doesn't use subroutines anymore!! Look at my screenshots.|Erik J.

factor|The Best Quadratic Factoring Program v1.5|This program FOILs out quadratic equations. If the value of "X" is imiginary or irrational, then it'll write "-NOT FACTORABLE". The program takes a little while to display the answer, but it comes out exactly perfect. Plus the program is really small, only about 1 kilobyte.|Ben Ilegbodu|1|ti-83plus/basic/math|TI-83 Plus BASIC Math|762|No|null|factor.gif|1|4|104
benquad|The Complete Quadratic Formula Program v5.5|Math Program in which user inputs coefficients of a quadratic equation and finds out what X equals and how the equation is factored. If X is not a rational number it will display it exactly how it would look simplified in the Quadratic Equation. Also shows the graph, and gives the discriminant and the vertex of the equation. You can also view the value for X in decimal form. Can correctly handle a negative value for A and fractional values for A, B, or C.|Ben Ilegbodu|1|ti-83plus/basic/math|TI-83 Plus BASIC Math|3,316|Yes|benquad2.txt|benquad.gif*benquad2.gif|11|52|225
convert|Convert! v1.0|This program may have bugs, its an old version, but if it works it will be quite worth your download. It makes about 25-30 Different Conversions. MirageOs compatable.|Jason D.
