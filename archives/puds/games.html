<p align="justify">In an effort to have a standardized definition of types of games, below are descriptions of various types of games as seen by <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/" target="_blank">Nintendo.com</a>.  Use this as a guide to find the exact type of game that you are creating.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Action</dt><dd>Adrenaline pumping fun is the name of the game in the Action genre. Whether you're hurtling through space at the controls of an X-Wing fighter or hurdling Goombas as Mario in the Mushroom Kingdom, Action games deliver excitement</dd>
  <dt>Adventure</dt><dd>Mix an in-depth storyline with intense action and you've got the Adventure genre. Explore settings as varied as the fantasy Kingdom or Hyrule to the colorful cartoon Mushroom Kingdom of Paper Mario</dd>
  <dt>First-Person</dt><dd>Lock and load! Step into the shoes of a secret agent, space marine or wise-cracking macho man and save the world from legions of bad guys. You may have an arsenal of gadgets, but your most trusty tool is sure to be measured in caliber size.</dd>
  <dt>Fighting</dt><dd>Master the way of the warrior. Whether it's a suplex or a roundhouse combo, you must learn the moves or suffer the consequences</dd>
  <dt>Puzzle</dt><dd>Tease your brain with a Puzzle game. Match, slide and stack to attack your opponent, or to just save your own skin. You'll need more than just quick reflexes to solve puzzle games-- you'll need a nuclear powered noggin</dd>
  <dt>Racing</dt><dd>When you feel the need for speed, no other genre satisfies like Racing games. Take the wheel of vehicles from all times and places-- bikes, personal watercraft, sports cars even sci-fi hovercars.</dd>
  <dt>Role Playing Games (RPG)</dt><dd>Role Playing Games allow you to assume the role of a character from another world. The storyline will immerse you as you build your alter-ego's strength and skills by mastering many challenges. Your ultimate triumph will only come after hours of in-depth game play.</dd>
  <dt>Strategy</dt><dd>Command armies, expand your territory, maybe even take over the world. Whether you battle sinister electronic cyber-foes or ancient armies of monsters, you can watch you power grow. Keep your friend close?keep your enemies closer.</dd>
  <dt>Sports</dt><dd>Virtually every major sport has made an appearance on video game consoles. From individual contests of skill like golf and tennis to team sports like hockey, soccer and football, your thirst for competition and multi-player action ends here.</dd>
