Strings2 is for general use in converting strings into lists and back.
The usage is very obvious.

String1 is for encrypting the string in Str1 and storing it into List STR2.
Change wherever you see List STR2 to whatever string you want to store into.
This is the format so other programs can call it in mid-running.

String2 is for decrypting while a program is running. Change wherever you see List STR2 
to the list that the string is stored in.
