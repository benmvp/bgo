****************************************************
Description:	Math Program in which user inputs
		coefficients of a quadratic equation
		and finds out what X equals and how
		the equation is factored.  Also shows
		the graph, and gives the discriminant
		and the vertex of the equation.
Files:		* benquad2.8xp
****************************************************
Manual:	
* Open BENQUAD.
* An Opening Screen will appear.
* Press ENTER, and you'll be prompted for what The
  coefficients A, B, and C equal.  Input values.
* If the values for X are rational, then the values are
  displayed (at the top) with the way the equation is
  factored (at the bottom)
* If the answer(s) for X are not rational numbers then
  the program will write the value for X just like it
  would be in the quadratic formula.
* After viewing the values, press ENTER.
* A menu will appear asking whether you want to see the
  graph of the equation, the discriminant, or the 
  vertex.  It also asks if you want to do another
  equation or if you want to quit.
* If you choose either of the first three, you can
  return back to the menu to choose another one.

**Note**: "sqrt" stands for square root

History:
v5.5 -- Now the program correctly factors and graphs the
	equation with a negative value for A
	Also, can correctly handle fractional values for
	A, B, or C
v5.2 -- Added Fraction and Decimal answer choice feature
v5.1 -- Fixed some bugs and added a little feature
v5.0 -- Got rid of the the subprograms and again shrunk
	the size of the file from 2500 bytes to 1595
	bytes.  Now there's only one program.
v4.5 -- Added discriminant and vertex functions
v4.0 -- Made the text look better and be more
	understandable.  Made the text of irrational
	values exactly like it would be in the quadratic
	formula.  Shrunk the size of the entire group of
	programs in half from about 4500 bytes to about
	2500 bytes.  Now the grouped file only has four
	programs
v3.5 -- Added radical simplification function
v2.5 -- Made it AShell83 Compatible
v2.0 -- Added the binomial factoring and linear function
v1.0 -- Original release
