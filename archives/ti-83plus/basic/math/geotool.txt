			Geometry Toolkit^2
			  Jason D. Ralphs

	This program was not designed to be used for cheating, if you use it as such I will not be held responsible.

	With that out of the way I can now tell you about the program.  It is very simple to use.  You just press the number that corresponds with your choice.  This program does not do the work for you, i just reminds you of what the formulas are.  Yes I did also write Formulas Toolkit v1.08 and v1.09.  This is basically just an uprgrade of them.  It still contais Note-It, but I've added an Ion Shell v1.06, my Dice program, a command prompt, a password module, my new guess the number program,  a more comprehensive help guide, and a theorums/notes section. When I upgrade this I will be adding My Convert program. Or maybe I'll just upgrade that.
