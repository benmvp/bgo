About
=====
This is my first "game" for TI-83 Plus.  It's a simple guessing
game.  However, what's different about this one is that it has
way better graphics and organization than any guessing game 
(or almost any game for that matter) that I know of.  It
also has three levels of difficulty and a high(best) score for all
of the three levels of difficulty.   You basically try to guess
the correct number in the least amount of tries.  After every
guess is a hint telling you whether you should go higher or lower.



How to Run
==========
Send nguess83.8XG to your calculator.
If your linking software doesn't automatically ungroup the files,
goto into your memory and ungroup nguess83.8XG.
Run nguess.8XP to play the game.



How to Play
==========
At the title screen, press ENTER to go to the main menu.
Select 1 to play, and 2 to exit the game.
Select either 1, 2, or 3, depending on the level of difficulty you desire.
Press   CLEAR   to return to the main menu.
You should be able to see the high(best) scores for each of the levels of 
difficulty just below where it says "Best Scores."
Now that you're in the game, enter random numbers to guess
the actual number.  Hints will be given after each guess.
