A fun text-based game where you take the role of a rent-a-cop and go to gang headquarters and shoot their asses. After that, you get to beat the final druglord boss. Includes small cigarette side-game to get more cigarettes and you can find pieces enemies drop for better weapon or parts. If you liked Drug Wars or Pimp Quest, this game is a MUST :) (Also MirageOS compatible)
