The Game:
This game is quite self explanatory.  Its the normal black jack.  If you have an ace and you go over 21 then the calculator will automatically change it into a one instead of an 11.  There are three saving slots and you must pay back your debt of 1000000 dollars.  Don't worry, it sounds like a lot but by being able to save you can do this quite easily.  Please do not separate this file from Blakjack.8xp but you may distribute this freely.
