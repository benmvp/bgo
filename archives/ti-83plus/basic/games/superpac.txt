********************************************************
Directions:
Send Superpac.8xg to your calculator.

Object:
The object of SUPER Pac is to beat all 10 levels and win
the entire game.  Not an easy task at all.

Keys:
Arrow keys -- move "c" around
MODE --	Pause during gameplay
CLEAR -- Quit during gameplay

Scoring:
-  You get 3 points for each dot that you eat
-  You get 5 points for each square that you eat

Additional Info:
The squares just give you 5 points instead of 3 points.
They do not enable you to eat the enemy, which, by the
way, can move through the walls.  After each level you
get bonus points for the time remaining.  After every
other level you get an extra life ("1-UP") to help you
along the way.  Trust me, you'll definitely need it.  If
you do beat the game, please let me know because I'll be
very impressed!


History:

v1.0	--	First release

Future Version:
v2.0	--	More levels if lots of people beat the
		game and any other suggestions I receive
