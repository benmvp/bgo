Requirements: At least 2511 RAM and you need to have pic0 available.

Whackm is a simple whack-a-mole game that tests your hand-eye 
coordination.  

There are 4 levels:
1)Easy -each hit = 1 point
2)Medium -each hit = 2 points	
3)Hard -each hit = 10 points
4)Very Hard -each hit = 30 points

The numpad corresponds with the different holes, i.e. 7=top left, 
3=bottom right, etc...
When you have hit a "mole", you will see a little asterik.
You are allowed 5 misses, and each miss counts as -1 point.

You will notice that when you start your very first game, circles 
will be drawn on the screen and then the game will proceed.  This DOES 
NOT happen every time!  The program is simply drawing out the gamescreen 
and then is saving it to pic0.  If you delete or change pic0 and your 
gamescreen no longer has the nine "holes", then go to the homescreen 
and enter in 0->LT(1).  LT is a list so the "L" should be the little L
found in the list menu.  Setting LT(1) equal to zero, causes the 
program to redraw the circles and save to pic0 again.
