********************************************************
1-Player Mode:
You have to guess a number between a certain range, which
is determined by the level you play:
Easy -- 1-100
Medium -- 1-1,000
Hard -- 1-10,000
Difficult -- 1-100,000
Impossible -- 1-1,000,000

1-Player vs. Computer Mode:
You have to guess a number between 1 and 1,000,000 and
you try to guess the calculator's number before it
guesses yours.

2-Player Mode:
Each player has to guess each other's number that is
between 1 and 1,000,000 or between 1 and the custom upper
range that you choose.  Also, each player has the option
of requesting assistance.  The first person to guess the
other person's number wins!

Hisotry:
Guess v7.5  -- In 2-player mode, each player has the
	       option of having assistance and a custom
	       upper range can be chosen
Guess v7.0  -- Replaced all regular menus with custom
	       menus
	       Created a nice animated opening screen
	       Added a Records page, which gives the
	       option to reset all records or just to
	       reset each individual one
	       Improved the 2-player mode so that each
	       player has to guess the other's number
	       Added the 1-P vs. COMP mode
Guess v6.0  -- Increased the "prediction" function by
	       making it so that the program will tell
	       you if your prediction was above or below
               your actual amount of tries.
Guess v5.6  -- Fixed a minor bug that prevented the game
	       from running
Guess v5.5  -- Added the "prediction" function and 
	       changed the record/prediction screen.
Guess v5.0  -- Fixed the different menus so that they
	       also include instructions.  Also fixed
	       some minor bugs that I didn't know
	       existed.
Guess v4.6  -- Erased previous high score set-up and
	       changed it so that each level has its
	       individual high score that can only be
	       deleted in the game.
Guess v4.5  -- added the 2-player mode
	       added the "pick your own range" mode

	       function in the level menu

Guess v2.0  -- made spacing appearance a lot better and
	       added the "assistance" function

	       problem
Guess v1.0a -- fixed minor bugs
Guess v1.0  -- original game w/ "between" function
