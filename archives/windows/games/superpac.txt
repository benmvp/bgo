Description:	Basic Pac-Man clone and TI-83 Port
Files:		* Superpac.exe
		* Superpac.txt
********************************************************
Directions:
* Create a subdirectory (folder) to put Superpac.exe in
* Put Superpac.exe in that folder and run it

Object:
The object of SUPER Pac is to beat all 10 levels and win
the entire game.  Not an easy task at all.

Instructions:
Most of the instructions are already in the game,
including the keys and scoring.  However, when moving the
Pac-Man around, do not hold down on the arrow key!  Once
you run into a wall, you'll keep on going into that same
direction for a very long time!  To move the Pac-Man
successfully and easily just tap at the same constant
pace that the seconds count down at.  It takes a little
getting used to, but once you've played it a little, you
will get the hang of it.

Note:
The highscores are kept in a file called Superpac.pac so
don't delete it or move it.  The file will appear in the
same directory from where you run Superpac.exe.

History:
v1.5	--	First release with all the features of
		calculator version 1.5

Future Version:
v2.0	--	2-player mode and possibly more levels
