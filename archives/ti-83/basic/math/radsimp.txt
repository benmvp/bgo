Manual:
* Run radsimp
* The opening screen will appear, press enter
* Input the number
* Input the index(root)
* Input the coefficient in front of the radical.  If
  there is no coefficient input 1.
* The simplified form of the radical will be displayed,
  press enter
* You will be asked if you would like to do it again: If
  "yes" it will ask you for another number, if "no"
   it'll go to the closing screen, press enter

Version History:
v5.0 - Added the "coefficient" feature
v4.6 - Fixed a bug when you try to find the root of a
       negative number.  It would display 1 inside the
       radical, which is unnecessary.
v4.5 - Changed some code so that the program runs faster
v4.0 - Reduced the size of the program from 1239 bytes
       to 967 bytes and made other minor changes
v3.5 - Made it AShell83 Compatible
v3.0 - Fixed all the spaces between numbers
v2.0 - Changed it so that it'll put sqrt if it the index
       is 2
v1.0 - first output of program
