Directions:
Send Memory2.83g to your calculator.

Object:
The object of Memory² is to match all 10 pairs of
numbered cards before the amount of tries remaining run
out.  You beat the entire game when you beat the 16th
level (which starts you off with 0 tries remaining).

Keys:
Arrow keys -- move card indicator around
2nd -- flips over selected card
CLEAR -- Quits game

Scoring:
-  You get 13 points for each pair you correctly match

Additional Info:
Level 1 starts off with 15 tries remaining.  Once you
beat that level, Level 2 begins with 14 tries left.  Then
you have 13 tries at the beginning of Level 3, and so on.
I'll be extremely, extremely impressed if you beat the
whole game, and let me know if you do.
