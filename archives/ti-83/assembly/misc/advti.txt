[Advanced TI-Windows v3.6]

Advanced TI-Windows v3.6 is an update of the previous version (Advanced TI-Windows v3.3). It is an windows look-a-like Shell-like program with mouse. With the menu's: file, preferences, utilities, and ?(help). On the desktop you can open 3 games and open your own programs by pushing [alpha]. I have used for the desktop [ALPHA] instead of [2nd] to keep the program run smoothly. It has the following assembly subroutines: Open, Shutdown, Background, PXL Change, Contrast, Memory, Protector, Avail Prgm, Version and when nescessary Alphalock. 3 Different ackgrounds are included, can be changed anytime! Memory can be checked with the util menu. You can see a Gif animation file if you click with your mouse on the file information button at the left!! Check it out.

[Note how to put programs in]
The user has to assign the icons to a program, see file4<info>.
To do this enter File4-File8 in the Program Edit Function.
In the file delete the contents and 2nd recall the program.
The last thing you have got to do is enter 'ZNAM', in that file
enter the name of the file for the desktop.
!!But be sure to keep <or reenter>: 0->Xmin ; 94->Xmax ; 0->Ymin ; 62->Ymax
recall picture0 at the end of your program also enter the right coordinates
to A&B for the mouse: A->45 ; B->40 (only if the program uses these variables)


[Bugs]
I think I got them all out of the program, if you find one please email me.
