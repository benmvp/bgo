<a name="info"></a><p>Do you want to know what being a BASIC Guru Online member will do for you?  Well, there are lots of perks for a member:
<ul>
  <li>Members will have the option to receive emails on site updates, site news, new weekly poll additions, poll results updates, and tutorial postings.</li>
  <li>If you have a website, a link to it will be added in the <a href="/cgi-bin/links/index.pl">Links Page</a>.</li>
	<li>If you're currently creating a program you can submit it to be listed in the <a href="../archives/puds/index.html">PUDs section</a> of the Program Archives.</li>
  <li>Members can <a href="#programs">submit their own programs</a> to be posted underneath their member profile.  These programs will be able to be downloaded by all BASIC Guru Online users, not just members.</li>
  <li>Members will recieve <a href="../archives/puds/index.html">PUDs</a> that are in the Beta Testing stage to play and test before it is released to the general public.</li>
  <li>Members' vote in the <a href="../awards.html#som">Site of the Month poll</a> and <a href="../awards.html#pom">Program of the Month</a> are worth double than those of the regular visitors</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The emails that you are receiving are different from a newsletter.  A daily newsletter would not work because there may not be news every day.  It is possible, however, to receive more than one email in one day.  If you do have a website and you list it in the <a href="../cgi-bin/members/sign-up.pl">sign-up form</a>, you must create a link back to BASIC Guru Online ASAP with the description: <i>An online set of BASIC programming tutorials for the TI-83 and TI-83 Plus.</i>  If you want to add anything else, that's fine.  The only requirement of a BASIC Guru Online member is that he or she vote in all of the polls, especially the weekly polls.</p>
