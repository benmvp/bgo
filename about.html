<a name="intro"><p>BASIC Guru Online, started August 3, 2000, is actually an online version of BASIC 83 Guru, a help file that I've made.  Hence the name, BASIC Guru <b>Online</b>.  The information in the help file and this website are the same.  In fact, the two are pretty much identical.  If you would like to download the help file so that you can access these tutorials without having to log on to the Internet, <a href="cgi-bin/archives/windows/utilities/progs.pl?prog=basicguru">click here</a>, and you'll be sent to the BASIC 83 Guru information page.  The Help file only gets updated after I finish an entire version (about 11 or 12 tutorials), while this website is updated after I finish one tutorial.  If I have enough time, I can possibly make one or two tutorials a day when I'm really focused.  Download the help file and see if you like it.</p></a>

<a name="purpose"><p><font size="3" color="#000080">The Purpose of this Website:</font><br />
The main reason why I decided to put my help file online is that I wanted it to be able to reach more people.  I feel that it would be easier for more people to find this website than it would be to find the website where you can download my help file.  In addition, I think that it will be more convenient for people to go through the tutorials on the Internet.  You also do not have to worry about having a big file on your hard drive.  Putting this on the Internet, has also improved my HTML skills.  The main reason why I started the tutorials in general is to teach people how to program their calculator using BASIC programming.  The reason I chose to make it for BASIC programming instead of Assembly programming is because I am better at BASIC and I feel that it is easier to teach.  For example, BASIC commands are in plain Standard English or understandable English abbreviations.  In Assembly, the commands to clear the screen are a series of numbers and letters (4755h).  In addition, I think BASIC is easier to learn because the commands are generally self-explanatory.  It's pretty easy to figure out that the command "Goto" means to go somewhere in the program.  In addition, I feel that the more people who know how to program in <b>any language</b>, the better games and other types of programs we will get for our calculators.</p></a>

<b>Ben Ilegbodu</b>: I am currently a junior at M.B. Lamar HS in Houston, TX.  I got my TI-83 in the eighth grade, and became very proficient at programming in BASIC.  I saw all the different games like Tetris and other people making programs so I decided that I wanted to learn.  Now don't get me wrong I'm no nerd.  Although computer programming interests me a great deal, I consider myself a really good basketball player and good at other sports.
