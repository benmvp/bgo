    <td colspan="2"><font size="2">The first topic in this news item is very important.  I've come up with an idea, which will make entering all those codes in the tutorials into your calculator much easier.  The only problem is that it'll take a lot of effort on my part.  To make sure that what I'm going to do is worth the effort, I need feedback from all of you.  What I want to do is have the option to download a calculator file version (83 and 83+) for each code in all of the tutorials.  This way, you won't have to worry about making mistakes while entering code and you don't have to spend the majority of your time entering that code.  You can spend that extra time learning more topics.  The only thing you'll need is the TI-Graph Link software and cable (to send it to your calculator).  Now, whatever your comments are please tell me by clicking on the "Discuss" link below.  If it's either to tell me that this is a great idea or that it's a terrible one, PLEASE TELL ME!!<br />
<br />
The second topic deals with BASIC Guru Online hosting unofficial news from you.  Have you ever wanted to announce something new about your site?  Has your site released a highly anticipated program and you want to get the word out?  Well, if you guys want it, there could be BASIC Guru Online Unofficial News, where you can post whatever news you have.  Even if it's just to announce a new program you've released and it's now in <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/" target="_blank">ticalc.org</a>'s archive, that's fine.  However, before I get the page up and running, I'm going to need some news to post.  If you have any news you would like to let everyone know about, send it to <a href="mailto:news@basicguruonline.com?subject=Unofficial&nbsp;News">news@basicguruonline.com</a>.  Once again, PLEASE send any comments about this idea, using the "Discuss" link below.<br />
<br />
The last topic deals with a feature that I'm thinking of adding to all of the program profiles.  I am thinking of adding a "NOMINATE ME" button somewhere on ever program profile, which will nominate that program for the upcoming POM poll.  So now, the question is: Would you rather dictate which program's are nominees in the POM by using the "NOMINATE ME" button, or would rather the 5 programs with the most downloads for that month be the nominees?  For the last time, PLEASE send any comments about this topic, using the "Discuss" link below.</font></td>

    <td colspan="2"><font size="2">Wow, it's been a long time since I last did one of these...almost 2 whole months.  The last time I wrote a news item, was when the site reached the 1,500-hit mark and just got the new domain name: basicguruonline.com.  But anyway, on to the new news.  As the headline indicates, the site has now received over 3,000 hits.  I think this is a remarkable feat to accomplish in only 4 months for a specialized site.  Other sites can get 3,000 hits easily because the main focus of the site is for all types of TI-graphing calculators, but this site mainly focuses on the TI-83 and TI-83 Plus.  It is evident, however, in the increasing hits and involvement in the polls that more and more people are learning about BASIC Guru Online everyday.  Next up is the <a href="home.html#poll3">current weekly poll</a> that asks what grade you are in.  I am pretty shocked to see that a little over 20% of the voters are in middle school or earlier.  I highly doubt that an elementary school kid would have a graphing calculator so I think that pretty much all of the votes are by middle schoolers.  I'll be even more shocked if even half of the people who voted "Middle school or earlier" aren't in the 8<sup>th</sup> grade.  There is really no need to buy a graphing calculator any earlier than that, I feel.  A regular TI-30X would suffice.  Almost 70% of the voters are in high school, which is a figure that I pretty much expected.  It's usually in high school, and most likely college, that you'll need a graphing calculator.  My final topic deals with an update that I'm planning to finish within the next week.  It's kind of hard to explain though.  What I want to do to every page on the site is something similar to what Yahoo! or ticalc.org do in their categories.  Let me just use my profile page as an example.  At the top of every page (beneath the title and subtitle, but above the main text, and in between two lines) there will be a sort of hierarchal line.  As I said, it's hard to explain, so I'll show you.  For my profile page, the "line" will read:
<center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans Serif"><a href="home.html">HOME</a> <b>>></b> <a href="members/index.html">Members</a> <b>>></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/members/list.pl">List of Members</a> <b>>></b> <b>Ben Ilegbodu</b></font></center>
I think that adding this will be useful and make navigating the site even easier, if that's possible.  :)  If you have any comments about any of the comments, just feel free to click the "Discuss" link below and drop your comments.</font></td>

    <td colspan="2"><font size="2">It's been exactly one week since my last news item.  I actually could've written the first topic about 3 days ago, but I wanted to wait and consildate everything into one big news item.  As of right now, the number of hits to the site stands at 1,551.  It actually took longer for the site to go from 1,000 hits to 1,500, than it did from 500 to 1,000.  It took about 3 weeks, give or take a few days.  Anyway, I'm glad that the site has even gotten this many hits.  It just means that it's getting out to the public!  My next topic is something that I'm really happy that I was able to implement.  It's something that I suggested to <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/" target="_blank">ticalc.org</a>, but they refused to respond to my suggestion.  But that's okay, because it's at BASIC Guru Online!  If you don't know, it's the program ratings and comments.  This allows the users, you guys, to give your input on how good a game actually is and leave your comments.  Every program in the <a href="archives/index.html">Archives</a>, is set up to be rated from 1 to 5 stars, and each already has a current rating.  This way, visitors wanting to download a program will <b>really</b> know how good the program actually is.  I'm also excited about the last topic.  BASIC Guru Online, now has a new domain: <a href="http://basicguruonline.com" target="_top">basicguruonline.com/</a>.  Now you can acess the site, by just typing in that URL instead of having to enter all the "geocities" stuff.  It should make things much easier and make my site even more official.  I'm going to have to go back to all those major search engines and change the web address.</font></td>

    <td colspan="2"><font size="2">It's been a while since I've had some big news to tell you about.  Well, as the title indicates, I have finally finished the <a href="faq/index.html">FAQ</a>.  It currently contains 45 questions, most of which I have been asked many times.  What's really weird is that once I started creating the FAQ, I started receiving lots of questions that would be answered in the FAQ.  This made me really want to get it out quickly.  However, that didn't happen for a number of reasons.  At the end of September I decided to make the Site of the Month and Program of the month polls to add more interactivity between the you and me.  By the way, those winners will be announced on October 14<sup>th</sup> (the date was moved from the 10<sup>th</sup>).  I also received a couple of members during this time period, including <a href="members/users/user021.html">Brandon Green</a>, the newest of the new members.  Brandon, an ex-member of <a href="http://sicode.ticalc.org/" target="_blank">SiCoDe</a> and a current member of <a href="http://www.xcoderz.com" target="_blank">xCoderz</a> (formerly <a href="http://www.basicoderz.com" target="_blank">BasiCoderz</a>), submitted a lot of his games that he's made for both program groups, including one for the <a href="/cgi-bin/archives/ti-82/basic/games/index.pl">TI-82</a>.  These games increased the <a href="archives/index.html">Program Archives</a> significantly.  Brandon also submitted 7 tutorials that he made for SiCoDe and now wants to add to the BASIC Guru Online set.  These tutorials are very advanced and will most likely added in a different section of the tutorials that I will be called "Member Submitted Tutorials."  Now that the FAQ is finally complete, I'm going to move on to creating the program rating system for all of the programs in the program archive.  This way, users can get an idea of what other users think of the program and how good it actually is.  Once that system is complete, I'll hopefully be able to resume making more tutorials.  If you haven't already done so please vote in both the Program of the Month and Site of the month polls, which are located on the <a href="awards.html">Awards Page</a>.  Also, if you have any more questions that you think should be added to the FAQ just <a href="contactme.html">tell me</a>.</font></td>

    <td colspan="2"><font size="2">This news item is a combination of three news items that I want to talk about.  First, I'm proud to say that BASIC Guru Online has now past the 1,000-hits-mark.  It was exactly two weeks ago that I wrote a news item talking about how the site surpassed 500 hits.  If it took one month to get the first 500 hits, and then two weeks to get the next 500 hits, could the next 500 come in one week?  I hope so.  Now on to the second news.  If you've ever asked me a question, you received asking you to vote in the BASIC Guru Online Customer Service Poll, which asks three questions about how I respond to your questions.  This poll is very important because it is instant feedback that I can receive from you.  I try to respond as quickly and accurately as I possibly can.  The final news deals with the FAQ that I'm currently making.  I have amassed all of the questions that you guys have asked and organized them into several sections.  I'm not quite sure when the FAQ will be finished because I have 48 questions to answer.  It all depends on how much other stuff I have to do with the website like updating polls and responding to questions.  Hopefully, it'll be done within the next week.</font></td>

    <td colspan="2"><font size="2">It's about time!!  I finally finished a tutorial.  It's called <a href="tutorials/special.html">Special Tutorial</a>.  The reason it is special is because it was not my idea.  The idea actually came from one of BASIC Guru Online's members, <a href="/cgi-bin/members/users.pluser=5">Ben Grunwald</a>.  He actually submitted a game that he thought would be good to use in one of the <a href="index/a-m.html#getkey">getKey</a> tutorials.  If I did include into one of those, there would have been a whole lot to explain in just one paragraph, so I decided to make a tutorial solely for it.  Thus, Special Tutorial was created.  It teaches: the Use of <a href="index/a-m.html#ans">Ans</a>, Continual Motion, and Collision Detection.  It actually turned out pretty good and there should be something new you learn.  Check it out!!  I'm once again taking a little break in order to update my Maze program.  It should only be a one day break because what I want to do, isn't that big.  The next major project that I'm planning for BASIC Guru Online is an FAQ, so <a href="comments.html">submit those questions</a>!!

I am reluctant to even change the weekly poll because the current one is doing so well.  I don't know what it is, but I'm glad it's happening.  Right now there are 11 <a href="members/index.html">members</a> (including me) and 17 programs in the <a href="archives/index.html">program archives</a>.  I hope that both will increase soon.  As you might have noticed, there hasn't been a tutorial released in a while.  This is due to the fact that I've been working on the HTML aspect of the site (adding all these cool features).  I will start making a tutorial as soon as I have finished adding all the features.  I have a free weekend coming up too, so that will give me some time.</font></td>

And one more thing.  Please vote in all three polls, not just the first one.  Thanks!!</font></td>

It really actually finished yesterday because I decided not to add the feature that I was going to add today.  <b>The biggest feature</b>, I think, are the 3 polls added to the home page.  These allow me to get instant feedback from you, which I can analyze and make the site better.  The <a href="home.html#poll1">first two polls</a> are fixed polls, meaning that they will never change.  Those polls will be there for the life of the website (which I hope is a long time).  These two polls ask you questions about the site.  The <a href="home.html#poll3">third poll</a> is a weekly poll, which obviously will change on the weekly basis.  These questions don't necessarily have to be about the website, but the first one is.  If I get enough votes, I'll create results pages for the polls which will probably be updated daily.  Please vote!  <b>Another important feature</b> added in the "mini overhault" are the anchor links at the top of each major page that has many sections.  These links allow you to be able to quickly navigate to a section in a page.  I think this will be helpful, especially when you want to get to the bottom of a long page.  This is also helpful for me because important info that's at the botton now shouldn't get overlooked.  The <b>final feature</b> that I added was the <a href="tutorials/index.html#email">tutorial submission section</a> of the tutorials page.  Now you can email me any tutorials that you would like to see added to BASIC Guru Online.  Your submissions are greatly appreciated.  Well that concludes this news update.  When anything else comes up where I feel I need to tell you something, I will post another news update.</font></td>

I'm now going to take a short break from making tutorials.  I'll still be updating the site a lot.  I will post the new weekly poll tuesday evening and update the results page.  You can still email me if you have tutorial suggestions, questions about tutorials, or anything else.  I'm just taking a break from making tutorials.
