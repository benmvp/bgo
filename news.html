    <td colspan="2"><font size="2">If you've been visiting BASIC Guru Online recently, you may have realized that the site has not been updated for a while.  This is due to many reasons, including the fact that I've been busy.  So in order to do away with any doubts that any of you might have, the site will no longer be updated.  I thought that this day would come much farther down the road, but it's here now.  Another reason for this is because I've lost interest in TI programming itself.  After working with languages like C++ and Perl, I just cannot go back to something far less powerful.  TI BASIC is a great way to start a programming "career", but all it is is a start.  It's not a middle, and definitely not an ending.  But that's the way it goes.  Us "old" guys move on and the young people take our place.  And speaking of taking places, BASIC Guru Online will <b>not</b> be handed down to anyone.  I don't want to sound selfish, but BASIC Guru Online started off as my idea, and with the help of many others' ideas it has grown, but it will not be manage by someone else.  I want to always say that BASIC Guru Online is/was solely mine.  So even though, I'm no longer updating the site, the tutorials will still be hosted here as long as F2S.com allows me to have this web space.  I will still answer questions to the best of my knowledge, and I might talk on the message board once in a while.  Just to let you know, the domain name basicguruonline.com will be expiring soon, so the only way to access the site will be through <a href="http://www.basicguruonline.f2s.com/">www.basicguruonline.f2s.com</a>.  I really do not see the need to pay $24.95 to renew the domain when I won't even really be maintaining it that much.  So to make sure that there is no confusion:<br />
<b>These will still exist:</b>
<li>Tutorials 1 - 30 (and the submitted tutorials)</li>
<li>Help Center where you can ask me questions or post on the message boards</li>
<li>All the existing programs</li>
<br>
<b>These will cease to exist:</b>
<li>Program Submissions</li>
<li>New Weekly Polls</li>
<li>Site/Program of the Month Polls</li>
<li>Member of the Month awards</li>
<li>Programming Challenges (would have ceased even if I kept on)</li>
<li>PUD submissions (all PUDs will end up getting delete when the 50 days are up)</li>
<li>Program Nominations</li>
<li>Other things that would cause me to manage the site...</li>
It's kind of sad to have to leave so soon, but as you probably already know, I'm working on a site for <a href="http://ivalo.ece.rice.edu/" target="_blank">Rice University's ECE Department</a> and I get paid for it.  It's also a lot of fun webmastering that site because it is constantly testing my limits in CGI programming and it's backed by a reliable database management system.  Who knows, BASIC Guru Online might have continued had I been able to find a site that will let me use SQL with relational database in Perl for free.  F2S.com has MySQL suppport, but it's only for PHP.  I have read all the message board posts, and I wish there was another way, but this is the only way.  If you have any comments, I would really like to hear from you.  So, signing off for the last time,<br />
